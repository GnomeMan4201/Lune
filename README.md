## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Packages: `psutil`

Install with:
```bash
pip install psutil
```

---

## 🔐 Configuring Your PIN

Create a hidden config file in your home directory:

```ini
# ~/.luneconfig
[auth]
pin = 42069
```

Change the PIN to anything you like. This replaces hardcoded values.

---

## 🧠 Usage

Start the shell:
```bash
python3 lune-ui.py
```

Then interact:
```
> list        # Show available modules
> run intelshare
> auditlog    # View recent audit entries
> sysinfo     # View system information
> exit        # Quit the interface
```

---

## 📓 Writing Your Own Modules

Each module should be placed in `startup/` and contain a `main()` function:

```python
# startup/ghostctl.py
def main():
    print("[ghostctl] Executed ghost control module.")
```

Once dropped in, it's callable via:
```bash
> run ghostctl
```

## 🧼 Tips

- `Ctrl+C` exits safely
- All access is logged to `~/.lune_audit.log`
- UI color & layout can be themed further
